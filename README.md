# Names in a Hat
===========================================================================
This is a family colaboration project to pick and pair names of people in the family with one another 
for Christmas gifts. This seeks to solve two problems:

1. Automate the pairing of people in the family for the purpose of one to one gift giving.
2. Solve the problem of spouses drawing eachothers names from the hat
